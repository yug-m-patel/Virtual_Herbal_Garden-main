          <p>
            Ayurveda, a Sanskrit term meaning "the science of life" (Ayur = life, Veda = science or knowledge), is one of the world’s oldest holistic healing systems. Originating in India over 5,000 years ago, Ayurveda integrates physical, mental, and spiritual wellness, offering a comprehensive approach to maintaining balance and health.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Origins of Ayurveda</h2>
          <p>
            Ayurveda's roots are deeply embedded in the Vedic traditions of ancient India. The system was first documented in the Vedic texts called the <i>Atharva Veda</i> around 1500 BCE, and later expanded in the classical texts, the <i>Charaka Samhita</i> and the <i>Sushruta Samhita</i>, written around the 4th to 6th centuries BCE. These texts are attributed to sage Charaka and sage Sushruta, respectively, who laid down the principles of Ayurveda and its application in healing. </p> </section>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Core Principles of Ayurveda</h2>
      <p>
        Ayurveda is based on the concept of <i>doshas</i>, which are three fundamental energies that govern our physiological and psychological processes:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-5">
        <li><b>Vata (Air and Space):</b> Governs movement, circulation, and communication.</li>
        <li><b>Pitta (Fire and Water):</b> Controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production.</li>
        <li><b>Kapha (Earth and Water):</b> Regulates growth, lubrication, and stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Maintaining a balance among these doshas is essential for health and well-being. Ayurveda uses diet, lifestyle, and natural therapies to achieve and maintain this balance.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Traditional Uses of Ayurveda</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-5">
        <li><b>Diet and Nutrition:</b> Ayurveda emphasizes individualized diets based on dosha types. For example, a person with a predominant Pitta dosha might benefit from cooling foods like cucumber and mint, while a Vata person might need grounding foods such as sweet potatoes and nuts.</li>
        <li><b>Herbal Remedies:</b> Ayurvedic medicine utilizes a wide range of herbs like Ashwagandha, Turmeric, and Triphala. Each herb is chosen based on its properties and how it interacts with the individual's dosha balance.</li>
        <li><b>Panchakarma:</b> This is a detoxification process involving five therapeutic procedures designed to cleanse the body and restore balance. Techniques include oil massages, steam therapies, and internal cleansing.</li>
        <li><b>Yoga and Meditation:</b> Integral to Ayurveda, these practices help balance the mind and body, contributing to overall well-being.</li>
